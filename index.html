                <p> I was <span>born</span> and raised in Scranton, PA or as most recognize as "the home of The Office". Growing up my family spent our yearly vacation oceanside in Long Beach Island, NJ and then in Kilmarnock, VA with cousins, aunts, and uncles. As an adult, I have started to explore some new places, including, Austria, Poland, and Costa Rica, but still return to Kilmarnock, VA each summer for our annual cousins weekend.

                <p><span> My passion:</span> I LOVE running- It's the most freeing and invigorating time in my day. I've run 10ks, half marathons, and full marathons, but my favorite runs are the daily runs after work through Uptown Charlotte, NC. This is where I go to clear my head and find an inner sense of peace in the day (amidst honking cars and loud buses lol). I leave my headphones and watch at home so I can take my environment around me (and to watch out for the scooter people!).

            <div class="div-3">
                <p><span>A fun fact:</span> I am very shy. I like to fly under the radar as much as possible. I enjoy being a key team player, but please don't ask me to give a presentation! I enjoy collaborating with others to develop innovative designs and improved user experience. I aspire to combine my interests in design with my passions in the areas of sustainability as well as health and fitness.</p>
